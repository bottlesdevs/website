We are really happy to announce that [Bottles](https://nlnet.nl/project/Bottles/) has been awarded a grant from the **NLnet Foundation** through the **2025 Commons Fund**.

This support will help us accelerate our work on the [Bottles Next](/posts/2023-10-05-bottles-next-a-new-chapter) project (also read [here](/posts/2024-12-27-rust-libcosmic-next) for updates), bringing a more modern and polished experience to running Windows software on Linux. The grant recognizes our efforts to build a better future for running Windows applications on Linux.

We are incredibly thankful to the NLnet Foundation and the Commons Fund for believing in our mission.

Interested in helping us push the project even further? [Get involved on GitHub](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/). Together, we can make Windows applications run smoothly on Linux, without being limited by outdated technology or restrictive environments.
