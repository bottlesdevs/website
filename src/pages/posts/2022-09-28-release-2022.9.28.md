It’s Release Day again!

This time we decided to take a little more time, both to take a break and to 
complete some long-tasks that would not have allowed us to meet the release 
date. This release brings many new features and improvements.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### New Display Dialog
We are always looking for new ways to improve the user experience, and this
time we have decided to give some love to the display options. Those options are
now located in a dedicated dialog, which is much more intuitive.

<img tooltip="Bottles Display Dialog" class="on-light" src="/uploads/display-dialog.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Display Dialog (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/display-dialog-dark.png" />

Settings are now positioned more intelligently and show more or less detail 
based on their state. For example, it will not be possible to change the 
resolution of the virtual desktop until it is activated, screen scaling on the 
other hand now provides an easier way to increase or decrease DPi instead of 
having to choose from the available options.

### Drag and Drop
Sometimes the best solution is also the simplest, and this is certainly the case 
with Drag and Drop. With this release infact it is possible to launch an 
executable by simply dropping it inside the bottle screen.

<video style="width: 100%; height: auto;" width="320" height="240" autoplay controls>
  <source src="/uploads/drag-and-drop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

This will show visual feedback indicating that you can release the executable to 
start it. You will no longer need to sail the seas looking for that file, simply 
drop it on top of it.

### Multiple Dependencies Installation Deprecation
In Bottles we experiment with many features even though we are not completely 
sure that these are useful. One example is just the installation of multiple 
dependencies in one shot.

<img tooltip="Bottles Removed Multi-Selection for Dependencies" class="on-light" src="/uploads/deps-no-selection.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Removed Multi-Selection for Dependencies Mode (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/deps-no-selection-dark.png" />

This feature was implemented some time ago at the request of users, but 
unfortunately this is a very problematic and risky feature since some
dependencies may irreversibly damage the bottle. Therefore, we have
decided to deprecate this feature.

This function also made novice users believe that it is a "right" operation 
because it is available, and this caused many problems including misunderstanding. 
Advanced users can still use custom recipes to create bottles with multiple 
dependencies by letting Bottles install at bottle creation.

### Instant Programs Add
It is always a bad experience when software is not responsive or you have to wait 
a few seconds for operations that should not take that time. In this release we 
have also worked on this aspect and it is easy to notice when we add a new 
program in our bottle.

<video style="width: 100%; height: auto;" width="320" height="240" autoplay controls>
  <source src="/uploads/bottles-instant-add-program.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Previously this procedure required rebuilding the entire program list, causing a 
small lag of ~2s. The new method applies the new program to the current list 
without having to recreate it, making it instantaneous and less noisy.

### Gamescope Dialog Improvements
The dedicated Gamescope dialog has been improved to be more intuitive and 
self-introducing.

### Other UI/UX Improvements
There are many UI improvements that have been applied in this release so let's 
look at a few more ones.

#### Libadwaita Migration Continues
Months ago we started our migration to **GTK4 and libadwaita**. While most of the 
work was completed quite some time ago, there were still a few tasks left to be 
completed. With this release we have completed almost the entire migration, 
leaving behind only a few small details that we will finalize in future updates. 
The interface is now clean, compliant and intuitive thanks to the wonderful 
work behind libadwaita.

Not straying too far from the **GTK topic**: in this release we moved from "legacy" 
XML **templates** for composing interfaces, to the new, modern [Blueprint](https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/)
format, making the interface much easier to read for new contributors and 
users interested in learning. This also reduced the codebase by about 800
lines!

Speaking of UX, now Bottles will **automatically hide features** that are not and 
never will be compatible with your setup, for example NVIDIA only settings will 
never be shown in AMD only setup, cleaning up the interface by removing 
unnecessary noise.

The **Components section** has been renamed to Runner Components as the previous 
Components section was confusing and did not give the idea of being the 
correct section when you wanted to interact with the runners or components 
connected to them like DXVK/VKD3D etc.. .

<img tooltip="Bottles Runners Components" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-runners-components.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Runners Components (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-runners-components-dark.png" />

Finally, improvements have also been made for mobile. Now the interface is 
completely responsive and can be used on small screens or spaces, without giving 
up indispensable features.

### Support for Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean Languages
In Bottles from different releases it is possible to force a different 
language for applications running through it. With this release we are 
expanding support with 3 new languages: Japanese, Taiwanese and Korean.

If you think a language is missing, please open a bug on our [GitHub](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/issues) 
so we can implement it.

We have also introduced an alternative of the progress bar via terminal, which 
is displayed as a fallback when the system is unable to display the standard 
one, for example due to a language problem or characters not supported by the 
system.

### Architecture-specific Dependencies
The dependencies in Bottles are in fact software that is installed in the 
bottle, for this reason it too depends on a series of rules and requirements 
including the architecture and the dependence on a specific version of the 
system, for example some dependencies require you to set the Windows version of 
the bottle to Win98 but this version is not compatible with a 64bit bottle 
(win64) and for this reason it cannot be installed, now Bottles automatically 
hides this dependency, preventing the user from stumbling into a compatibility 
problem, potentially harmful to its bottle.

### Support For Bundled GStreamer Plugins
Some runners provide a specific or custom version of the GStreamer plugins, 
hich are essential for playing multimedia content. To ensure their maximum 
compatibility, Bottles now identifies these and prefers their plugin versions, 
loading them before the version provided by Bottles.

### Release Numbering Changes
From this release the numbering of Bottles versions changes slightly, 
removing the codename from the version and changing the punctuation, thus 
moving from the previous model 2022.8.28-brescia-1 (year.month.day-codename-patch) 
to the new 2022.8.28.1 (year.month.day.patch).

### Runners Updates
The Soda runner has been updated to latest Valve commit, providing support for
new games and improvements to existing ones.
The Caffe and Vaniglia runners has been updated to Wine 7.18.
