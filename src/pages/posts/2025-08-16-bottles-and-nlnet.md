Hello everyone,

A few days ago, the news broke that Bottles had received the [green light from NLnet](https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-08-04-nlnet-commons-fund/). This was wonderful news, which made us proud and energized. However, reading the media headlines and some comments from the community, I realized that perhaps some clarity is needed.

**First important thing: we haven't received the funding.**
A European call for proposals doesn't work like a direct bank transfer to a project's account. It works like this: the project is selected, receives the "green light," and from that moment on, a process of discussion and planning begins to define the actual budget it will be eligible for and how it will be spent. In our case, these funds will be dedicated to Bottles Next, not Bottles in its current form.

We've been following this call for proposals since **January 2025**; it didn't just fall from the sky. It was a long process, involving writing, revisions, and patience. When the green light was confirmed, we had a meeting with the NLnet team and the other selected projects. It was a wonderful meeting, almost like a welcome party.

What struck me most was the preparation of the NLnet team: people with a wide range of skills, from technical to legal to organizational, all ready to offer support. And what exuded from every word was open source. It was like feeling at home, among people who speak our language.

But back to the point: **this news doesn't mean Bottles is financially secure.**
NLnet funding, when it arrives and in the amount established, will benefit Bottles Next. Bottles, the one you use today, the one receiving maintenance and updates, continues to exist thanks to donations.

And I'd like to add an important clarification: **Bottles Next, when it's ready, will also live on donations from the community.** NLnet funding is a huge support, but it's not infinite. They're needed to get things started, to build the foundations, not to sustain the project forever. Over time, the same donations that support Bottles today will be transferred to supporting Bottles Next.

Unfortunately, since the news broke, we've seen donations decline, especially recurring ones. Probably because some thought, "Now they have European funding, there's no point in donating anymore." In reality, it's the opposite. The funds don't cover servers, maintenance, or running costs. And without direct support, the risk is that Bottles will be overshadowed before Next is ready.

Recently we lost one of the advantages offered by a provider that guaranteed us free hosting for open source. Those servers were essential for distributing the infrastructure load globally. They won't be renewed, and so today everything rests solely on the (fortunately solid) shoulders of Hyperbit. But even they, alone, can't work miracles.

NLnet's green light is a wonderful achievement, but it's only the beginning of a journey that will require time and work. Bottles Next will arrive, but Bottles needs you now. And when Bottles Next becomes a reality, it will continue to need the community, just like it does today.

Thank you to those who are close to us, to those who have supported us for a long time, and to those who believe this project deserves to grow further.

PS. We are preparing a new article with more details about Bottles Next, how is development going, what is accomplished so far, and what's next. Stay tuned.

â€” Mirko
