Over the years, Bottles has grown into a tool that helps thousands of users running Windows applications on Linux with ease and flexibility. This journey has been possible thanks to the dedication of the team and the support of our amazing community.

Today, we’re reaching out to invite you to support Bottles and ensure we can continue to deliver innovative features and improvements. Your contributions help us maintain and expand Bottles, ensuring it remains a powerful and accessible tool for everyone.

Let's talk about stats, Bottles got **2.2 million downloads** since its first pubblication on Flathub, we know this is not the counter of unique users, but it's a good number to start with. We have **6.5k stars on GitHub** and many contributors that helped us to improve the software. We are proud of what we have achieved so far, but we know that we can do more with your help... and we actually need it.

## Why Your Support Matters

Developing Bottles is cool and all, but it also requires time, resources, and funds. From foundational features like the **Dependencies Manager** and **Installers**, to big features like **Per-bottle sandboxing**, **Layered Bottles**, and the upcoming **Bottles Next**, every step we take involves significant effort and investment. For example, Bottles has its own infrastructure with servers, CDNs, and services that need to be maintained and expanded (a very special thanks to [HyperBit](https://hyperbit.it/?ref=bottles) for providing the servers and [fabricators.ltd](https://fabricators.ltd?ref=bottles) to provide the expertise).

Each donation helps us:

- Enhance Bottles’ performance and compatibility
- Accelerate the development of long-awaited projects like **UMU integration** and **Bottles Next**
- Bring Bottles to new platforms, ensuring a consistent user experience across Linux and **macOS**

Our goal is to continue creating tools that make Wine accessible without the complexity, and your support is crucial to achieving this vision.

Every contribution, big or small, makes a difference, it does for real.

## Join Us in Shaping the Future

Bottles has a bright future, with ongoing projects like:

- [DONE] **Library Mode**: Seamless access to programs in a library view
- [ALPHA] **Per-Bottle Sandbox**: Enhanced security through isolated environments

- [NEXT] **Bottles Next** [[i]](https://usebottles.com/posts/2023-10-05-bottles-next-a-new-chapter/): A complete overhaul with modular architecture for Linux and macOS compatibility

Each feature brings us closer to realizing Bottles’ full potential, but we need your help to get there. Visit our [Funding Page](https://usebottles.com/funding/) to learn more and contribute.

## Why?

Bottles was started as a personal project by me, Mirko Brombin, to help users run Windows applications on Linux. Over time, it has grown into a big project, used by thousands of users worldwide. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved so far, but I am starting to feel the weight of the project on my shoulders. I need your help to continue developing Bottles and bring it to the next level.

I am not going to stop developing Bottles, but I need to invest more time and to do so, I have to cover my expenses, because investing more time means less time for my job and my family. I am asking for your help to make this possible.

Together, we can continue to build a tool that empowers users and redefines Wine management. Thank you for being part of this journey!

_ Mirko B.
