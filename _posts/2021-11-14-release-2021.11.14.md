It’s Release Day again!

This release brings with it many new features, not only in Bottles itself but 
to the entire environment. We have worked hard to get even closer to the 
community and offer an even better user experience.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Environments even more powerful
From Bottles v2 the Environments were introduced for the creation of the 
bottles. These are environments that preconfigure a bottle with specific 
configurations to allow them to be compatible out-of-the-box with a large 
chunk of programs.

Today these environments are even more powerful and are not limited to 
preconfiguring DXVK, VKD3D and other bottle settings, but now also install 
dependencies on their own to drastically increase compatibility with Windows 
software.

The dependencies installed by the environments are usually the most common 
used in that context, for example for the Gaming environment all the 
dependencies commonly used to run a video game are installed. This in 
combination with DXVK, DXVK-NVAPI, VKD3D and other settings, allows the bottle 
to support a lot of video games right out of the box.

To use them, just proceed as usual, selecting the desired environment when 
creating the bottle. Bottles will take care of the rest.

Obviously using one of these environments (Gaming, Software), the creation 
process will take longer than before, but only the first time, as all 
dependencies are saved in an internal archive and Bottles will not download 
them again for the next bottles.

If, on the other hand, you want to proceed manually, avoiding this automation, 
you can continue to use the Custom environment, which provides a clean and 
ready-to-tweak bottle.

### Quick access to executables
More advanced users will appreciate this new feature. This is a quick access 
to the last run executables, useful when you are testing multiple 
configurations. In fact, it often happens that you need to start the same 
executable over and over again during the testing phase.

In this version we have introduced a new menu next to the "Run executable" 
button, this shows the last 5 executables and clicking on them will 
automatically start in the current bottle.

This feature is not intended as a permanent history for executables, in fact 
it only lasts for the entire session and is reset when Bottles is restarted.

If you want to save a program for future use, we recommend doing it through 
the Programs section, adding a new entry if this is not automatically 
detected by Bottles.

### Switch Windows version
Bottles now supports switching between Windows versions. Normally this is 
done through the `winecfg` tool. In this release we have integrated the 
switcher directly into the bottle preferences.

This feature only works with bottles created from this version onwards.

### Windows version per dependency
Our dependency manager is designed to automate complex Windows package 
installation processes. For example for vredist or DirectX.

With this version it becomes even more powerful and automated. In fact, it 
can now install a package through a specific Windows version, without 
actually changing the bottle version. This allows you to install packages 
that would otherwise not work because the Windows version of the bottle is 
higher or lower than needed.

```yaml
Name: dotnet35
Description: Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
Provider: Microsoft
License: Microsoft EULA
License_url: https://www.microsoft.com/web/webpi/eula/net_library_eula_enu.htm
Dependencies: []
Steps:
- action: uninstall
  file_name: Wine Mono

- action: use_windows
  version: winxp
  executable: dotnet35.exe
..
```
The above is an example of [dotnet35](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/dependencies/blob/main/Essentials/dotnet35.yml), 
the package that installs the .NET Framework 3.5. Normally it is necessary to 
change the version in Windows XP to be able to install it because in Windows 7 
and above it detects that it is already provided (when it is not true, of 
course), then the manager will set the version necessary for that single 
executable and will then be able to install it without actually change the 
bottle version.

### Gamemode via Flatpak
Thanks to a community member who worked on the thing (read the changelog at 
the end of the article), it is now possible to use the gamemode also via 
Flatpak. This in fact is supplied directly with Bottles and therefore 
identified. Just enable the dedicated setting in the Preferences section 
of the bottle to be able to use it.

### Pass arguments to Bottles CLI
Thanks to another community member, it is now possible to pass arguments 
to an executable using the Bottles CLI.

```bash
flatpak run com.usebottles.bottles -e file.exe -b MyBottle -a "arg1 arg2"
```

This is a very useful feature especially if you use the CLI to create 
Desktop Entries or shortcuts that start a program via Bottles.

### Random crashes
In this version we investigated Bottles' random crashes that were due to 
a mix of threads. Some functions on third-party threads were trying to 
access the main thread, causing the entire application to crash without a 
trace or crash report.

We have fixed these issues and should no longer occur.

## Flatpak-first
In a [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/usebottles/status/1458767254649282561) 
where we ask if Flatpak should become Bottles' default distribution format, 
the majority (almost all) gave their consent. So here we go. Announcement time!

Bottles married Flatpak several months ago now, after a period of adjustment 
(normal when adopting a new technology or tool), we are officially announcing 
that Flatpak becomes Bottles' first distribution format. At the moment it is 
the most tested package of all and any future updates will be made with 
particular attention to this format.

**Wait.** This does not mean that we will abandon the other packages but that 
we will prioritize this one. To date we officially support many formats, 
[here](https://forums.usebottles.com/d/5-list-of-official-packages/3) the 
complete and updated list. 

Different discussion instead for our Snap package instead which has been 
[officially deprecated](https://twitter.com/usebottles/status/1456167337367949315) 
after months of trying to get good results. Unfortunately, the problems are too 
many and we don't have the effort to investigate yet.

### New Website
As mentioned, this Release Day is not just about the program, there is so 
much more.

We have updated the project website, improving Bottles' presentation, 
explaining its main features. On the first page of the site you can see 
sections that introduce them and that refer to the dedicated page of the 
documentation.

#### Official Forums
With the number of issues constantly increasing, it has become essential for 
us to divide reports from community discussions. In addition to this, we 
believe it is useful to offer Community members a space in which to talk 
about the project and where they can easily reach the development team.

For this reason we have opened the official [Bottles's Forums](https://forums.usebottles.com), 
where we have already posted some interesting content. Check them out!

## To our community
We would also like to spend a few words to talk to the community about the 
project.

Bottles is growing really fast and we notice it more and more every day. 
The software is more and more used and is expanding fast thanks to all your 
feedbacks and contributions. For this we would like to dedicate this Release 
Day to you, as a thank you for the attention you are giving us.

I speak for myself (Mirko), this is my first Open source project that 
reaches so many goals and I have to thank you all. This project could never 
have improved this much without the contribution of this great community, 
so I'm proud of all of you. Thank you, it means a lot to all of us.
