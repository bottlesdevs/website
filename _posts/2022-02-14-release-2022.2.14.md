It’s Release Day again!

Another two weeks of work has been done and it's time to celebrate another
release day!

This release brings with it many new features, some in great demand and others 
that you are sure you will like. Even if the project grows fast and each new 
version has always introduced something new, this update is a game changer 
because it takes Bottles out of the concept of the common wineprefix manager 
and enters the automation of the software installation. Ok, this is something 
that has actually already been seen in other programs but in ours we have tried 
to do things a little differently, we will talk about it shortly.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Installers
In 2019 we announced Bottles v2, a complete rewrite of the project that 
included a bunch of very pretentious features, including versioning, a 
dependency manager, a component manager and support for installers. All these 
features have been integrated a little at a time and today we officially 
announce the arrival of the installers, completing the circle.

#### What are installers?
These are sets of instructions interpreted by Bottles to replicate the 
installation of a program. This process is written in manifest files by the 
maintainers, who were able to install the program following the same steps.

Unlike other managers, these installers use the structure and tools offered by 
Bottles to automate the entire process and not break the "logic" of the bottles, 
keeping all the logged parameters (dxvk, vkd3d, esync, fsync ..) as well as 
the dependencies. Versioning will also be used if enabled, to create restore 
points in the installation phase (this is the level of integration we are 
talking about, each new version must be able to be exploited by the installers 
directly or indirectly, creating a single ecosystem where each component 
communicates perfectly with the others).

#### How to use them?
Now the installers are enabled by default, just open the bottle you are 
interested in and access the Installers section, then choose the one you are 
interested in and press the button to install it.

In the list you will also see a grade **(Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)**, 
these indicate the compatibility level of the application. Unlike others, the 
grade is decided after the installation of the program, including all the 
tweaks applied by the installer, thus evaluating the final user experience of 
the program and not how "complex" it was to install it.

So if a program is rated Bronze, it means that everything that (at the moment) 
could be done has been done to make it go, the program works but not perfectly 
(graphical glitches, rare crashes) and some features are not accessible. If it 
is Silver it means that everything works but that there may be minor bugs or 
minor functionalities blocked, then Gold if all the functionalities are 
accessible and any glitches are not blocking. If the rank is Platinum it means 
everything works perfectly.

</div>

Each maintainer must review the installer before publishing it and making it 
accessible to everyone. This and the manifest are accessible from the 
installers screen, using the installer context menu.

When the installation procedure is complete, you will be able to go back to the 
programs list and find the installed program, ready to run. You can run the 
installation multiple times even in the same bottle, so if a major update is 
done by the maintainer, or you just broke something and want to "refresh the 
installation", just re-install it. Obviously this will detect that the program 
is already installed and in many cases you will be offered to repair it, so it 
will be up to you to decide how to act, however dependencies and parameters of 
the bottle will be re-aligned with the installer instructions.

> At the moment there is no notification of an installer update but it will 
> come with a later version.

Installers define the required arch to run them, so if you are running a win32
bottle, all win64 installers will not be shown in the list.

### Apps catalog
With a view to future growth of this feature, we have created a 
[dedicated section](https://usebottles.com/appstore/) on the website, where all
installers are listed and easily browsed.

<img alt="Bottles app catalog" src="/uploads/bottles-appstore.png" class="shadow" />

It is possible to filter the installers by degree of compatibility, while 
from the dropdown we can reach the manifest and by clicking on the installer 
title we access the facilitated overview with screenshots and other useful 
information.

<img alt="Bottles app details" src="/uploads/bottles-app-details.png" class="shadow" />

See a full example [here](/app/#epicgamestore).

We are still working on the user reviews system and it will be available soon. 
This will be more of a user comments / feedback system, as the review is that 
of the maintainer, so these comments should be aimed at giving advice and 
feedback to the maintainer.

### Change bottles default location
Most requested feature ever. I know you asked for it too.

With this release it is possible to change the default path where bottles are 
stored. This is very useful if you want to use an external drive, a dedicated 
partition or just have them in another location.

![Bottles default location](/uploads/bottles-custom-path.png)

To enable it simply go to Bottles preferences and look for the Custom bottles 
path item in the Advanced section in General (Bottles restart required).

> Note that in the case of Flatpak, you will need to give Bottles permission 
> to access the path if it is outside the sandbox. Read the documentation 
> [here](https://docs.usebottles.com/flatpak/expose-directories).

Changing the path, your bottles present in the original path will remain 
(if there are any). You can reset the setting at any time always from the 
Bottles Preferences.

### Runtime for everyone
A few releases ago we [announced the Bottles Runtime](https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2021.12.14/#bottles-runtime), 
a bundle of useful libraries and resources that (if any) injecta Bottles into 
its environment to ensure runner compatibility.

As the functionality was still on trial, it was limited to Flatpak users only 
as it was easy to provide it directly with installation. From this release it 
is finally available for everyone!

![Bottles runtime for everyone](/uploads/bottles-core-components.png)

Flatpak users will always find the latest version of the updated runtime along 
with Bottles. All other users, on the other hand, if it is not the first 
launch, will have to install it through the appropriate new Core section in 
the Bottles preferences, in the first launch it will be installed together with 
all the other essential components (*~ 10MB*).

Unlike other components such as runner, dxvk, dxvk-nvapi and vkd3d, this one 
cannot be installed in multiple versions but is instead updated.

### Search in bottles list
In some cases our bottle list can become very long, it depends on how many 
tests are done, for example if you are a maintainer or just want to do a lot 
of experiments, so we have integrated a search bar.

![Bottles search](/uploads/bottles-search.png)

This hidden by default and is shown when there are at least 10 bottles.

### Taskmanager improvements
The integrated Task manager has received some improvements and the ability to 
terminate processes. This might be an obvious feature for a Task manager but 
Bottles' previous structure did not allow to implement it, and thanks to the 
new WINE backend introduced in the last release, we are now able to provide it.

To end a process, just select from the list and press the dedicated button from 
the headerbar.

### Caffe 7.2
The new Caffe runner is based on WINE 7.2, read [here](https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.2)
