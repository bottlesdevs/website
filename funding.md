    <h2>Our plans for Bottles</h2>
    <p>We have several plans for Bottles' future, many features that take time
      and money to come true.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Layered bottles</h3>
        <p>This is our solution for multiple environments in one bottle. This is
        currently a 
        <a href="https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/issues/510" target="_blank">concept</a>,
        but we are working on it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Installers</h3>
        <b>Now implemented!</b>
        <p>This is a feature in early development. It is an automated Windows 
        software installation system based on a community driven 
        <a href="https://github.com/bottlesdevs/programs" target="_blank">repository</a> 
        and itis already 
        <a href="https://docs.usebottles.com/bottles/installers" target="_blank">available</a>
        as an experimental feature in Bottles. Even if it already works, it 
        still requires some work before reaching a stable release.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dependencies manager</h3>
        <b>Now implemented!</b>
        <p>This is the most important feature of Bottles. It is a dependency
        manager based on a community driven repository, that replace winetricks 
        in Bottles and allows you to install software dependencies in a 
        simple way. It is already 
        <a href="https://docs.usebottles.com/bottles/dependencies" target="_blank">available</a>
        as a stable feature but it still in active development.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bottles is (today) a project driven by the effort of a small developer team and the support of a magnificent community!</p>
